# ARC Unobtrusive Validation

## Updates
Adding in support for user defined Form Submit handlers as well as what I think is proper validation for radio buttons and checkboxes.

ARC Unobtrusive Validation is a TypeScript-based library that integrates with ASP.NET MVC and Razor Pages to provide a streamlined client-side validation experience. It replaces the need for jQuery and jQuery unobtrusive validation scripts, allowing developers to perform validation against Data Annotations directly on the client side without extra dependencies.

## Motivation

Developed to replace the bulky jQuery and jQuery unobtrusive validation, ARC Unobtrusive Validation offers a modern, lightweight alternative for handling Data Annotations-based validation on the client side.

## Features

- **No jQuery Dependency**: Reduces the overall size of your application and removes the need for jQuery.
- **ASP.NET MVC and Razor Pages Compatibility**: Seamlessly works with server-side Data Annotations.
- **TypeScript-Based**: Leverages TypeScript for type safety and modern JavaScript features.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Transpiled with Webpack to ensure support across all modern browsers.
- **Ease of Integration**: Simple to incorporate into your ASP.NET projects with minimal setup.
- **Open Source**: Available for community contributions and custom enhancements.

## Getting Started

To integrate ARC Unobtrusive Validation into your project, simply include the transpiled JavaScript file in your application bundle. The library is designed to work out of the box with minimal configuration, making it an ideal choice for both new and existing ASP.NET applications.

## Why ARC Unobtrusive Validation?

ARC Unobtrusive Validation aims to provide developers with a modern validation tool that aligns with the latest web development standards. By moving away from jQuery, it ensures that your client-side validation is both efficient and up-to-date with current best practices.
